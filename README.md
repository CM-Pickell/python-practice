# python-practice

My personal collection of Python programming practice files.
Expect them to be filled with notes, redundant code, and test cases.

None of these files are intended for use other than learning via comparison.
If you know a cleaner way of coding a practice case, feel free to let me know!

Some Notes:
1. I initialize variables when possible.
2. I always validate inputs.
3. I always prefer readable over concise code.
